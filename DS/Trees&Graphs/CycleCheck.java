There are many ways to 
    Find existence of a cycle in Graph,
    Find out whether its a DAG,
1. Using normal dfs to find any existence of backedges using an extra data strucure or even colors technique
2. Using BFS to find if a node is revisited
    Find out a valid order of elements that may/may not block each other due to their temporal relationships
3. Trying to topologically sort the graph
